        <b>IMPORTANT!</b> It is very important that you stay on this page while waiting to be matched. Do not open or switch to other tabs,
        and remain at your computer station. Switching to different tabs is seen as a sign of inactivity, which <b>disqualifies
        participants</b> from being matched. <b>If you switch tabs, you'll <u>lose priority</u> in the waiting group,
        potentially leading to an inability to receive a task assignment.</b>
