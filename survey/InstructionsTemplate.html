        <h3 class="card-title">TASK 1: Individual Evaluation</h3>
            In the first task, youâ€™ll review a tweet to assess its credibility. This means, <b>based on the latest available
            evidence, do you believe the tweet is misinformed or potentially misleading?</b>
        <br>
        <br>
            Please, explain your reasoning in writing. Provide context that you feel will help others understand why the tweet
            is or is not misleading. It is helpful to cite sources. The text should be no more than 280 characters, and
            URLs do not count towards this limit.
            <br><i>NOTE: You may open new tabs only to look for sources to cite in your evaluation.</i>
        </br>
        <br>
            You have up to <b>{{ C.INDIVIDUAL_TIME }} minutes</b> to complete the first task. If time runs out, you will
            proceed to the collaborative evaluation task, <u><i>potentially impacting your payment</i></u>.

        <h3 class="card-title">TASK 2: Collaborative Evaluation</h3>
            After having submitted the individual evaluation, assess the same tweet's credibility with a partner.
            Determine if it's misinformed or potentially misleading, and write an explanation together. Provide context
            that you feel will help others understand why the tweet is or is not misleading. It is helpful to cite sources
            The text should be no more than 280 characters, (excluding URLs).
            <br><i>NOTE: You may open new tabs only to look for sources to cite in your evaluation.</i>
        <br>

            Collaboration is essential for successfully completing the experiment. Use the <b>chat</b> to communicate
            and <b>agree</b> on the final text with your partner. <i>Be aware that we'll monitor chat history to verify collaboration.</i>
        </br>
        <br>
            We strive to avoid dropouts, but can't guarantee it. If your partner is unresponsive, use the <b>chat</b> to
            get their attention. If they stay unresponsive, submit the same evaluation as in the Individual task. After we
            review your chat history, you may get a show-up fee and the opportunity to participate again in the future.
            <b>If you prefer not to collaborate, exit now.</b>
        </br>
        <br>
            You have up to <b>{{ C.COLLABORATIVE_TIME }} minutes</b> to complete the second task. If time runs out, you won't be able to complete
            the study. Note that this <u><i>will affect your final payment</i></u>.
