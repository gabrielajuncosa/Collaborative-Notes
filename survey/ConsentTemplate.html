  <h2 class="card-header">Welcome!</h2>
  <div class="card-body">
    <p class="card-text">
                Thank you for taking part in the study. This research is being conducted by Dr. Margaret Samahita and
                Dr. Taha Yasseri at University College Dublin, and it has received ethical approval from the university's
                ethics committee. To participate, <b>you must be at least 18 years old. You are prohibited from taking
                part in the study more than once.</b>
            </br>
            <br>
                In this study, you'll review a tweet and assess its credibility based on the latest available evidence.
                You'll evaluate the tweet alone first and then with a partner. Collaboration is mandatory for completion
                and payment. When collaborating, use the chat box to communicate and come to an agreement on the final text.
                <i>We’ll monitor chat history to verify collaboration.</i> <b>If you cannot commit to actively collaborating
                with your assigned partner, please exit now. Leaving the study midway stops other participants from completing it.</b>
            </br>
            <br>
                The study takes around <b>25 minutes.</b> Allow extra time for partner matching. The study requires your
                <i>full and undivided attention</i>. <b>Do not leave the computer station or open other tabs/browsers
                mid-experiment. If you cannot commit to giving this study you full attention, please exit now.</b>
            </br>
            <br>
                <b>IMPORTANT!</b> It is very important that you stay on the study's page, especially while waiting to be
                matched. In this study, switching to different tabs is seen as a sign of inactivity, which <b>disqualifies
                participants</b> from being matched. <b>If you switch tabs, you'll lose priority in the waiting group,
                potentially leading to an inability to receive a task assignment.</b>
                <br><i>NOTE: You may open new tabs only to look for sources to cite in your evaluation.</i>
            </br>
            <br>
                If the study cannot find you a partner or if you cannot complete the Collaborative Evaluation task due to
                an unresponsive partner, you must <b>complete the Individual Evaluation task</b> to receive a <b>£2.40
                ($3.02)</b> payment. You'll also be granted the opportunity to participate in a future session.<br>
                <br>
                If you <b>complete both the Individual and Collaborative Evaluation tasks</b>, you'll receive a
                <b>£1.60 ($2.01)</b> bonus (<b>total payment £4.00 ($5.03)</b> ) and a lottery entry for a chance to win
                <b>£100 ($125)</b>. <i>NOTE: Payments in GBP; USD amount may vary due to exchange rate fluctuations.</i>
            </br>
            <br>
                Your responses are anonymous and will be analysed along with those of other participants, and only the
                overall results will be published in a scientific article. If you want to withdraw, close the survey
                window. If for any reason you wish to withdraw your data from the study after completing the survey or
                have any questions or concerns, please contact us at <a href="mailto:taha.yasseri@ucd.ie">taha.yasseri@ucd.ie</a>.
